# Athletics-Data-Collection

[简体中文](./README.md) | [English](./README-EN.md)

Several objectives of the project:

- Set up some **active** profile pages for famous athletes (the WorldAthletics has an official profile, but I wanted to make it more **intuitive**)
- Collect competition data from Diamond League, Olympics and World Championships (probably just report cards)
- Summarize the data for each season
